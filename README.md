# About this Covid-19 Project.

The main aim of the project is to provide real time data of the stats of affected countries. There is an option to sign in with google account. Which let's you sign in and subscribe to updates. (future implementation: make a cron job to send emails to user on a regular interval) 

## APIs that I am using

Google OAuth 2.0 https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in

Covid-19 https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/covid-193


### Features

* Smart table which uses datatable jquery library which gives advanced option such as number of results in table, full sorting of the column content, overall search for the table.

* Get Historical Data: Select any country from the list and provide the date to get historical result.

* Subscribe to Email Updates: Sign in using Gmail and subscribe to updates. Sends an email to the user's email account. (Future implementation cron job for automatically sending emails at the end of the day, everyday)
